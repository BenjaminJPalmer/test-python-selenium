# test-python-selenium

This program is my first dip into using Selenium for automated testing. My language of choice for this is Python.

## Features

In it's current state, the .py file will take the urls from the .csv file. For each url, the program will try to load the page. If successful a screenshot will be taken, if not an error message will be printed.

## TODO

Add writing functionality so that the screenshot name or error message is printed to the .csv file.
